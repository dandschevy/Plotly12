## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to analyze the data related to belly button bacteria and create 3 different data visualizations:
  1. Simple decending order graph of the top 10 cultures found
  2. A bubble graph showing the bacteria cultures per sample
  3. A gauge chart showing the how often a test subject washed their belly button

There was an additional assignment to update the page with at least 3 customizations.  In this case, the three customizations added were:
  1. Adding a background to the title section
  2. Change the title section to bold and all capital letter
  3. Change the graph/chart titles to bold
